## üóÉÔ∏è Database - Room (with KSP)

* **Technology:** Room + Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP)
* **Entity Schema:**

```kotlin
@Entity
data class Product(
    @PrimaryKey val id: UUID,
    val name: String,
    val price: BigDecimal,
    val stock: Int,
    val description: String,
    val imgSrc: String? = null
)
```

* **Preloaded Database:**
  App ships with an initial pre-populated `.db` located in:

```
app/src/main/assets/appDb.db
```

Loaded at runtime via:

```kotlin
Room.databaseBuilder(app, Database::class.java, "appDb")
    .createFromAsset("appDb.db")
    .build()
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Handling

* **Sources:**

    * **Gallery (content URIs)**
    * **Camera (files saved in app's internal storage `/data/user/0/.../files/`)**

* **Storage Strategy:**
  Image paths are saved as `String` inside the database field `imgSrc`.

* **Display:**
  Coil (`rememberAsyncImagePainter` + `AsyncImage`) is used for loading images into Jetpack Compose UI.

* **Supports:**

    * Local files (`file://...`)
    * Assets (`file:///android_asset/...`)
    * Content URIs (`content://...`)

## üíâ Dependency Injection - Hilt

* Fully DI-enabled project using **Hilt**.
* Provides:

    * Room Database instance
    * DAO instances
    * ViewModels with injected repositories and use cases

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture - MVI (Model-View-Intent)

The app follows a **unidirectional data flow** based on **MVI architecture**, with the following layers:

* **Model:**
  Holds state (`ProductState`) and data.

* **View:**
  Pure **Jetpack Compose** UI, observes state from ViewModel.

* **Intent / Events:**
  UI triggers **events** (like `ProductEvent.AddProduct`, `ProductEvent.SetProductImageSrc`), which are handled inside the ViewModel.

* **ViewModel:**
  Processes events, updates state (`MutableStateFlow`), communicates with Repository/Database.

---

## üé® UI - Jetpack Compose

* Entire UI built in **Jetpack Compose**.
* Material Design 3 components.
* Uses Compose best practices like **StateFlow**, **collectAsState()**, **Composable Recomposition**, etc.

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcus-exe/vinheria-app.git
```

2. Open in **Android Studio Giraffe** (or newer).

3. Sync Gradle and build.

4. Run on emulator or physical device.

## üìÇ Notes

* **First Launch:**
  On fresh install, the app will populate the database from `assets/appDb.db`.

* **Image Persistence:**
  Camera images are stored persistently in app storage (`filesDir`).
  Gallery images use **persistable URI permissions**.

* **Reset Behavior:**
  If user **uninstalls** the app, the preloaded DB will load again on next install.

* **ADB Tips:**
  To debug Room database or image files, you can pull them from:

  ```
  /data/data/{your.package.name}/databases/
  /data/data/{your.package.name}/files/
  ```
